# My Interview Prep Repo

This repository contains some questions I worked on during my technical interview prep.

## Contents:

### LeetCode

Divided in folders according to level of difficulty. For eg, Easy folder obviously contains the questions marked 'easy' on leetcode.

Written in Javascript. I've used a test driven approach so each problem also contains associated tests.

To run tests, go to the LeetCodeJS directory `cd LeetCodeJS`. Then use `npm install` to install all the dependencies. I used [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) to write unit tests. Once in the LeetCodeJS folder, use `npm test` to run all tests.

More questions to come.

### LeetCode v.2.0

This is my second attempt at practicing LeetCode problems. 2018. I'm trying to use as many ES6+ things that I possibly can and this time I'm going in sequence - solving questions irrespective of their toughness. 

### CTCI
Questions from Cracking the Coding Interview, divided by chapters, written in Python.
